I am a full-stack web developer and designer. Engineering undergrad from IET DAVV, Indore

I work on the MEAN stack to design and develop robust, modular and minimalistic web applications.

I have worked on various projects in various domains. I have professional experience of two live projects during my internships.

I am passionate for technology and I love to write about it. I also sketch and draw. My love for science led me to this journey in computer science while the artistic kid in me was curious to explore designing.
